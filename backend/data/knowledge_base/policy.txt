**Account Safety Guidelines**
- Never share your OTP, PIN, or CVV.
- Bank officials will never ask for sensitive details over the phone.
- Report lost cards immediately via the mobile app.

**EMI Calculation Formula**
EMI = [P x R x (1+R)^N]/[(1+R)^N-1]
Where P is Principal, R is monthly interest rate, and N is tenure in months.
For Example: If P = 1,00,000, R = 1% (12% per annum), N = 12 months.
EMI = 100000 * 0.01 * (1.01)^12 / ((1.01)^12 - 1) = 8885.
